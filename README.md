# AI-Powered-Smart-Waste-Bin-for-Sustainable-Transport-Hubs
Our project addresses the critical problem of inefficient waste management at transport hubs by introducing an AI-powered Smart Waste Bin that not only classifies but also decomposes and compresses waste on-site, promoting sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. This smart bin leverages multi-sensor technology, including hyperspectral imaging, gas sensors, IR, RFID/NFC, and AI algorithms, to classify waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories. Organic waste is broken down through a bio-decomposition chamber, while non-biodegradable waste is compressed using Electroactive Polymer Sorting, reducing its volume by up to 80%.

The system features LoRa WAN/5G-based connectivity for real-time waste level monitoring and AI-optimized route planning, thereby reducing unnecessary collection trips and operational costs. One of its standout features is a blockchain-based incentive system where users are rewarded for responsible disposal using QR code scanning. This not only promotes public participation in recycling but also enhances accountability and traceability in waste management.

What sets this project apart from existing systems is its ability to process waste at the source, making it more efficient and environmentally friendly. Unlike traditional smart bins that only sort waste, this solution reduces landfill contribution by up to 70% and drastically lowers transport-related emissions. It is designed to be cost-effective and scalable, with an estimated prototype cost ranging from ₹20,000–₹60,000, and mass production bringing the cost down to ₹8,000 per unit.

This project is aligned with future urban needs and can be integrated into smart city infrastructure. Planned extensions include biogas utilization for public transport, a mobile app for recycling reward tracking, and advanced AI capabilities for more granular waste type identification. The AI-Powered Smart Waste Bin represents a bold step toward smart, sustainable, and decentralized waste management in the urban ecosystem.
